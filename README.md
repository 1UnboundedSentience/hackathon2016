## Schedule

The event's schedule is as follows:

* 10 AM: The event starts.
* 12 PM: Lunch.
* 3 PM: Presentations begin.
* 4 PM: Wrap-up.

We'll have to clear out of the venue by 5 PM.

## Process

The Hackathon will take the following form:

* Participants will split up in teams of 4. Teams can self-organize as they
  wish, but it's suggested they pick 1-2 team members to serve as "API
  Consumers" and the rest of the team to act as the "API Provider" (comprising
  backend developers, API owners, architects).
* Teams will get [one of the API toolsets](#api-toolsets) assigned to them.
  It's strongly suggested, but not mandatory that the team uses that toolset to
  complete the exercise.
* Teams will attempt to improve, enhance and document the subject API in the
  time available.
* The scope of this exercise is the HTTP/REST API definition, documentation and
  prototype/mock only. A server or front-end implementation is neither
  required, nor expected. The API definition and documentation should be
  checked in or linked to the hackathon's GitHub public repo.
* At the end of the allotted time, teams will elect one spokesperson to present
  their solution and one spokesperson to describe the process they used and
  feedback on the toolset used.
